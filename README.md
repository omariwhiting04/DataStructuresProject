This project visualizes several fundamental data structures using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). It provides an interactive interface for users to explore the functionality and structure of various data structures such as Heap, Binary Search Tree (BST), Stack, Queue, Priority Queue, Red-Black Tree, and B-Tree.

The project serves as an educational tool to understand the behavior and operations of these data structures.

Technologies Used
	•	Language: C++
	•	Framework: SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
	•	Build System: CMake

Features
	1.	Interactive Menu:
	•	Navigate through the menu using Up, Down, and Enter keys.
	•	View visualizations of different data structures.
	•	Press Escape to return to the main menu.
	2.	Data Structures Implemented:
	•	Heap: Demonstrates insertion and removal in a binary max heap.
	•	Binary Search Tree (BST): Shows the dynamic structure of a binary search tree.
	•	Stack: Visualizes push and pop operations in a last-in-first-out structure.
	•	Queue: Displays enqueue and dequeue in a first-in-first-out structure.
	•	Priority Queue: Implements a queue where elements are dequeued based on priority.
	•	Red-Black Tree: Balanced binary tree with node coloring and rotations.
	•	B-Tree: Multiway tree with ordered keys and node splitting.
